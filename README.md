# my zshell_configs

I'm giving zshell another shot, here are my configs.

my `~/.zshrc` is just basically:

```shell
# History, always need a history
source ~/.zsh/history.zsh

# Checks, need to verify what system we are running on.
source ~/.zsh/checks.zsh

# Aliases
source ~/.zsh/aliases.zsh

# colors
source ~/.zsh/colors.zsh

source ~/.zsh/completion.zsh
source ~/.zsh/history.zsh
source ~/.zsh/setopt.zsh
source ~/.zsh/exports.zsh
source ~/.zsh/prompt.zsh
source ~/.zsh/bindkeys.zsh
```
